# Connect-4
Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the
top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. Built using JavaFX . The project folder here also contains the compiled source
code and the artifact as the .JAR file . The modification of source code and taking the whole credit of this project without mentioning my
name or informing me , is strictly illegal and if any one found coping the source code , then strict plagiarism actions will be taken , So
without copying , enjoy the source code only for educational purposes. This project also needs no further development except the version 2
of this project , version 2 of this connect 4 game is not fully smooth , so any one interested can help to build the second version ,
Thank you !
